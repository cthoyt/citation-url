Parse URLs for DOIs, PubMed identifiers, PMC identifiers, arXiv identifiers, etc.

This module has a single `parse()` function that takes in a URL and gives back
a CURIE pair (with `None` as the first entry if it could not parse)

```python
>>> import citation_url

>>> citation_url.parse("https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01708")
('doi', '10.21105/joss.01708')

>>> citation_url.parse("http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34739845")
('pubmed', '34739845')

>>> citation_url.parse("https://example.com/true-garbage")
(None, 'https://example.com/true-garbage')
```

## üïµÔ∏è Why?

I wanted to be able to curate a list of papers in
[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org), make an XML export, extract and normalize
the messy contents in the `text-url` and `pdf-url` fields, then ensure
that there are appropriate entries on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org)
by using the Su Lab's
[Wikidata Integrator](https://github.com/SuLab/WikidataIntegrator).

Reuse this functionality with:

```shell
$ python -m citation_url.zotero --help
```

## üöÄ Installation

The most recent release can be installed from
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/citation_url/) with:

```bash
$ pip install citation_url
```

The most recent code and data can be installed directly from GitHub with:

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/cthoyt/citation-url.git
```

## üõ†Ô∏è For Developers

<details>
  <summary>See developer instrutions</summary>

The final section of the README is for if you want to get involved by making a code contribution.

### Development Installation

To install in development mode, use the following:

```bash
$ git clone git+https://github.com/cthoyt/citation-url.git
$ cd citation-url
$ pip install -e .
```

### ü•º Testing

After cloning the repository and installing `tox` with `pip install tox`, the unit tests in the `tests/` folder can be
run reproducibly with:

```shell
$ tox
```

Additionally, these tests are automatically re-run with each commit in a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/cthoyt/citation-url/actions?query=workflow%3ATests).

### üìñ Building the Documentation

```shell
$ tox -e docs
``` 

### üì¶ Making a Release

After installing the package in development mode and installing
`tox` with `pip install tox`, the commands for making a new release are contained within the `finish` environment
in `tox.ini`. Run the following from the shell:

```shell
$ tox -e finish
```

This script does the following:

1. Uses [Bump2Version](https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version) to switch the version number in the `setup.cfg` and
   `src/citation_url/version.py` to not have the `-dev` suffix
2. Packages the code in both a tar archive and a wheel
3. Uploads to PyPI using `twine`. Be sure to have a `.pypirc` file configured to avoid the need for manual input at this
   step
4. Push to GitHub. You'll need to make a release going with the commit where the version was bumped.
5. Bump the version to the next patch. If you made big changes and want to bump the version by minor, you can
   use `tox -e bumpversion minor` after.
